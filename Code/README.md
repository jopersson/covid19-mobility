- To estimate the models and produce their figures of estimates and diagnostics, run scripts under "Analysis".

- To generate additional figures and tables, run scripts under "Plotting" and "Tables"

Preprocessed data for the above tasks is included under "Data".

The preprocessed data is generated from the raw source data by first running all "load..." scripts in folder "Data_preprocessing", and then running "merge_data.R".
