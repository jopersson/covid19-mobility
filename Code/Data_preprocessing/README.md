### Data preprocessing

1. Run all "load" scripts to output preprocessed data for analysis.
2. Run "merge_data.R" to output merged data set for analysis.

Note: As the preprocessed output data are already available under "Data", the above steps are not necessary for running the scripts in "Analysis", "Plotting", or "Tables".
