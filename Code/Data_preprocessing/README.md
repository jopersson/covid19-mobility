### Data preprocessing

Scripts "load..." take as input the raw source data and output preprocessed data to subdirectories under "Data".
These scripts require the raw data, which are not shared under "Data" due to copyright. The raw data is publicly available for download in links provided in the respective repositories under "Data".

Script "merge_data.R" take the preprocessed data as input and outputs "Merged_panel_data.csv" under "Data". This is the data set used for analysis.
